This repository aims at providing some guidlines for energy experts to make a RDF document. RDF is a standard for exchanging data. If you want to learn about the RDF standard, please check out [this page](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) for more details. The Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG), is based on the RDF standard and the [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) format. Fundamentally, we use the [OEO ontology](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology) as the schema for our RDF document. It means, the OEKG is under development according to the OEO conceptualization. [This image](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oekg/blob/main/OEKG-Template/OEKG_Template_V1.0.1.pdf) shows the latest version of the OEKG template. As the OEO evolves, this template may change accordingly. 


We are actively creating RDF graphs from energy study reports. For example, [this report](https://www.oeko.de/publikationen/p-details/klimaschutzszenario-2050-2-endbericht) contains information about the energy scenarios, spatial regions, sectors and the models used in a study. Instead of conveying these terms in a natural language, we aim at expressing these concepts and their relations in a RDF graph according to the OEO conceptualizations. For this reason, we use some intermidiate data structures called [placeholders](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oekg/tree/main/place-holders)  which are  .JSON files with a simple structure. Through [this Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oekg/blob/main/How-to-develop-OEKG/How_to_develop_OEPKG.ipynb), you can find a guidline about how to read this placeholder files and convert them toa single RDF document. Indee, the OEKG is a big RDF graph containing the information about energy studies. It enables interoperability among energy studies. [Here](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oekg/tree/main/OEKG-Turtle), you can find the latest version of the OEKG in a Turtle format. It contains 948 facts (or triples). You can aslo load this Turtle file with the [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) and run SPARQL queries on it.
